      <p>The question is not whether AI replaces search, but how it changes the model of the web.</p>
      <p>If you have a generic question, you want an answer, not a list of ten blue links. But if you are looking for a specific entity—a restaurant, a person, a file—you want that entity.</p>
      <h3>The Unbundling</h3>
      <p>We are seeing the unbundling of "Search" into "Answers" and "Discovery". Google has been trying to do this for a decade with "One Boxes", but LLMs make it possible at scale.</p>
      <p>This changes the economics of content creation. If the AI summarizes your article, nobody clicks. If nobody clicks, nobody sees the ads. If nobody sees the ads, the content goes away.</p>
